# Time-Series-Forecasting-On-The-S-P500-Index

This project uses a recurrent neural network architecture to predict the S&P500 Index as a machine learning exercise. Tensorflow was used to train the neural network and perform optimizations (increasing epochs, add hidden layers). LSTM models were used to improve the RNN performance. Non-random data splitting and windowing techniques were used to enhance the performance and perform training, validation and testing.
